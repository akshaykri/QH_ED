# QH_ED
This package provides tools for modeling the quantum Hall system via exact diagonalization.

Currently supports the fractional quantum Hall effect with system at various filling fractions, in various Landau levels, and for a variety of interactions.

Allows for calculating the low-energy spectrum via sparse matrix diagonalization, and calculation of various correlation functions.

More features to be added.
